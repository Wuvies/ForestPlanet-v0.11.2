          <p class="this-article-explore body-2-regular">
            This article explores how the High Atlas Foundation (HAF) collaborates with farmers to transition from
            monoculture to sustainable fruit tree cultivation, such as figs, offering economic stability and
            environmental benefits.

          <p class="everywhere-we-travel body-2-regular">
            Everywhere we travel we see underlying economic forces driving unsustainable behavior. Alternatively, when
            unsustainable behavior begins to deliver diminishing returns it’s an opportunity to offer economically
            viable alternatives that also provide ecological benefits. Decision windows open and close quickly, so the
            right team with the right ideas and tools needs to be ready.<br /><br />Case in point: there are thousands
            of smallholder farmers (i.e. less than 10 hectares) in Morocco who have been relying on mono-cropping for
            decades. Like in most areas of the world, mono-cropping can be water, fertilizer, and pesticide intensive,
            mostly to make up for poor soil quality. The focus is on immediate yield, not soil health or the crop’s
            nutrient density.<br /><br />In Morocco, farmers allocate large portions of their land to winter wheat
            (which has been doing well), and other large portions to summer corn. Sadly, the corn yields have been
            dropping steadily in recent years due to excessive heat and drought. Yet another casualty of climate
            change.<br /><br />However, our in-country partners, the High Atlas Foundation (HAF), are in close contact
            with many Moroccan farmers and stand ready to offer an alternative. Such is the story of Mohammed’s farm,
            located outside the town of Khenifra in the Middle Atlas Mountains.  Mohammed has worked on a 20-acre farm
            his entire life. Like most of his neighbors he mostly planted mono-crops in the winter and summer, along
            with keeping a small vegetable garden and a few energetic chickens (who are guarded by peacocks!). Like his
            neighbors, his yields for summer corn are down about 50% from five years ago.

              amazing tree nurseries around the country, focusing mainly on nutrient-dense fruiting trees that can
              generate reliable incomes for decades. Each nursery has room for 200 – 300 thousand seedlings, and species
              include fig, pomegranate, olive, carob, cashew, and Argan.</span

            Ahmed and HAF proposed a bold shift to farmer Mohammed: carve out ~25% of his land dedicated to the corn
            crop and plant 1,000 healthy fig tree seedlings instead. While the long-term benefits are known, there are
            short term risks that farmer Mohammed must manage. Fig trees typically take three to five years to start
            producing fruit. They need to be ~10 years old before they reach maximum production levels. While they are
            maturing, they require water, care, and attention.

          <p class="story-item-1 body-2-regular">
            Thanks to Ahmed’s persuasive efforts, the first 1,000 fig tree seedlings were delivered in December 2022,
            when they were already ~12 months old. We’ve seen this time and again, and all over the world, that healthy
            seedlings produced by well-run nurseries have very high (i.e. 95% or higher) survival rates. This fact helps
            reduce farmer Mohammed’s financial risk.<br /><br />Why fig trees? They produce highly nutritious fruit for
            many decades, possibly hundreds of years. At current market prices, each tree can produce ~$100 per year in
            income. This is good money for farmer Mohammed, and more than makes up the losses due to lower corn
            yields.<br /><br />And of course, like all other trees, this species enriches the soil, channels rainwater
            to the aquifers, cools the micro-climate, and enhances biodiversity.<br /><br />And the chickens love the
            nutrient-dense addition to their feed!

              during our visit in December 2023. Like any good portfolio manager, the goal is to diversify his
              investments by planting a variety of tree species. By late 2024 he hopes to add olive and Argan trees to
              the mix.</span

              Allocating land to fruiting trees isn’t the only way to increase a farm’s income, but it’s a great start

            <p class="this-article-explore-1 body-2-regular">
              This article explores how the High Atlas Foundation (HAF) collaborates with farmers to transition from
              monoculture to sustainable fruit tree cultivation, such as figs, offering economic stability and
              environmental benefits.

              Everywhere we travel we see underlying economic forces driving unsustainable behavior. Alternatively, when
              unsustainable behavior begins to deliver diminishing returns it’s an opportunity to offer economically
              viable alternatives that also provide ecological benefits. Decision windows open and close quickly, so the
              right team with the right ideas and tools needs to be ready.<br /><br />Case in point: there are thousands
              of smallholder farmers (i.e. less than 10 hectares) in Morocco who have been relying on mono-cropping for
              decades. Like in most areas of the world, mono-cropping can be water, fertilizer, and pesticide intensive,
              mostly to make up for poor soil quality. The focus is on immediate yield, not soil health or the crop’s
              nutrient density.<br /><br />In Morocco, farmers allocate large portions of their land to winter wheat
              (which has been doing well), and other large portions to summer corn. Sadly, the corn yields have been
              dropping steadily in recent years due to excessive heat and drought. Yet another casualty of climate
              change.<br /><br />However, our in-country partners, the High Atlas Foundation (HAF), are in close contact
              with many Moroccan farmers and stand ready to offer an alternative. Such is the story of Mohammed’s farm,
              located outside the town of Khenifra in the Middle Atlas Mountains.  Mohammed has worked on a 20-acre farm
              his entire life. Like most of his neighbors he mostly planted mono-crops in the winter and summer, along
              with keeping a small vegetable garden and a few energetic chickens (who are guarded by peacocks!). Like
              his neighbors, his yields for summer corn are down about 50% from five years ago.

              Ahmed and HAF proposed a bold shift to farmer Mohammed: carve out ~25% of his land dedicated to the corn
              crop and plant 1,000 healthy fig tree seedlings instead. While the long-term benefits are known, there are
              short term risks that farmer Mohammed must manage. Fig trees typically take three to five years to start
              producing fruit. They need to be ~10 years old before they reach maximum production levels. While they are
              maturing, they require water, care, and attention.

            <p class="frame-221-item-1 body-1-regular">
              Thanks to Ahmed’s persuasive efforts, the first 1,000 fig tree seedlings were delivered in December 2022,
              when they were already ~12 months old. We’ve seen this time and again, and all over the world, that
              healthy seedlings produced by well-run nurseries have very high (i.e. 95% or higher) survival rates. This
              fact helps reduce farmer Mohammed’s financial risk.<br /><br />Why fig trees? They produce highly
              nutritious fruit for many decades, possibly hundreds of years. At current market prices, each tree can
              produce ~$100 per year in income. This is good money for farmer Mohammed, and more than makes up the
              losses due to lower corn yields.<br /><br />And of course, like all other trees, this species enriches the
              soil, channels rainwater to the aquifers, cools the micro-climate, and enhances biodiversity.<br /><br />And
              the chickens love the nutrient-dense addition to their feed!

                trees during our visit in December 2023. Like any good portfolio manager, the goal is to diversify his
                investments by planting a variety of tree species. By late 2024 he hopes to add olive and Argan trees to

                Mohammed. Allocating land to fruiting trees isn’t the only way to increase a farm’s income, but it’s a
